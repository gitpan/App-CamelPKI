App/CamelPKI version 0.01
========================
    

INSTALLATION
Make sure Module::Build and File::Slurp installed on your computer.

To install this module type the following:
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

On Ubuntu, packages can be necessary to install perl dependencies :
- apache2-threaded-dev

HOWTO CamelPKI Quick and Fast
1. Installation of the required softwares :
Some applications must be installed in order CamelPKI to work :
I give between parenthesis the name of the package in Ubuntu (add all default repository to sources.list). Under gentoo, fonctionnalities
are controled by use flags that are generally well explained.
- apache (apache2) : php5 (libapache2-mod-php5), perl(libapache2-mod-perl2)
- php (php5-cli) : mod_json(php5-json), curl(php5-curl)
- libssl0.9.8
- libssl-dev
- libnet-ssleay-perl
- libdb4.3-dev
- unzip
- build-essential

2. Installation of the Perl Modules :
You have to install some perl modules from CPAN in order to make work the application.
(steps required to install a module from CPAN ca be found on Google). (During my installations i found that 3 required modules form Crypt::OpenSSL::CA are not installed ... FIXME : find these modules)
In this step, CPAN has to be up-to-date (install Bundlle::CPAN and upgrade).
install Module::Build File::Slurp MIME::Base64 Error DateTime Sys::Hostname DBD::SQLite DBIx::Class IO::Socket::INET Catalyst Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple Catalyst::Action::RenderView Catalyst::Engine::Apache JSON Catalyst::View::JSON SQL::Translator Crypt::X509 IPC::Run Test::Group Test::More Test::Builder File::Which File::Slurp File::Find Cwd Errno LWP::Simple LWP::UserAgent Convert::ASN1 IO::Socket::SSL Catalyst::View::TT HTTP::Request::Form Data::Dump Crypt::OpenSSL::CA

3. Extract the App-CamelPKI archive and create your own app_camelpki.yml (a sample ca be found 'app_camelpki.yml.sample').

3. Key Ceremony - Preparing the application
	Key ceremony is an important task to do. You have to generate your own
	Certificates and Private Keys for the CA. A script has been dÃ©velopped in order
	to do this easily :
	$perl Build.PL
	$./Build
	$./script/camel_pki_keyceremony.pl var/
	From this point, the CA Certificate's and keys can be found in the var/ directory.
	And now the tests :
	./Build test
	TO pass php tests in Ubuntu you have to decomment the two lines in file t/php/php-json.ini. Under gentoo, you can comment them ;)

4. Launch the server
	Be sure, before this phase to complete your own config file (app_camlpki.yml)
	If you have apache and mod_perl installed, you could launch the server with apache
	$./script/start_stop_camel_pki.pl start (stop in order to stop it)

	or you can use Catalyst itself :
	$./script/camel_pki_server.pl
	
5.Generate Client's certificate in order to have permission to generate and issue
	new client's certificates (we suppose key and certificates are contained in var/)
	For this operation we will use openssl :

	$ cat var/admin.key var/admin.pem >	admin.glob
	$ openssl pkcs12 -in admin.glob -export -nodes -out cert.p12
	
	From this point, the file cert.p12 is a certificate in pkcs12 format.
	It can be handled by your browser to authenticate on the PKI.
