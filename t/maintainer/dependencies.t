=head1 NAME

dependencies.t - Checks that B<Build.PL> lists all required CPAN modules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test looks at the dependencies listed in the C<requires> keys in
B<Build.PL>, and matches them against the actual run-time dependencies
of the distribution's codebase.  It then combines the dependencies
listed in the C<requires> and C<build_requires> keys, and matches them
against the actual compile-time dependencies.  If any module is listed
in C<Build.PL> and not an actual dependency or vice versa (barring a
well-known list of false positives and "pervasive" modules), the test
fails.

This tests uses L<Module::ScanDeps>, whose guts it rearranges in a
creative fashion so as to eliminate most false positives and be able
to pinpoint lines of source code in case the test fails.  This results
in a somewhat quirky implementation, but OTOH this test is only
intended for running on the maintainer's system.

=head1 TWEAKABLES

=head2 %is_subpackage_of

A hash table that associates dependent packages
(e.g. C<DBIx::Class::Schema>, C<Catalyst::Controller>) to the
canonical top-level package in their distribution
(e.g. C<DBIx::Class>, C<Catalyst>).  Requirements and dependencies
that name a key in %is_subpackage_of will be treated as though they
were the corresponding value instead.

=cut

# FIXME: use Module::Depends or some such to compute this
# automatically.
our %is_subpackage_of =
    ( "Catalyst::Controller" => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::View"       => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::Model"      => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::Runtime"    => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::Utils"      => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::Action"     => "Catalyst",
      "Catalyst::Test"       => "Catalyst",
      "DBIx::Class::Schema"  => "DBIx::Class",
      "DateTime::Duration"   => "DateTime",
    );

=head2 @pervasives

The list of modules that can be assumed to always be present
regardless of the version of Perl, and need not be checked for.  By
default only pragmatic modules (starting with a lowercase letter) and
modules that already were in 5.000 according to L<Module::CoreList>
are listed.

                     File::Basename File::Find);

=head2 @maintainer_dependencies

The list of modules that are used in C<t/maintainer>, and for which
there should be provisions to bail out cleanly if they are missing (as
demonstrated at the top of this very test script).  Provided such
modules are not listed as dependencies outside of C<t/maintainer>,
they will be ignored.

=cut

our @maintainer_dependencies = qw(Pod::Text Test::Pod Test::Pod::Coverage
                                  Test::NoBreakpoints Module::ScanDeps
                                  IO::File);

=head2 @sunken_dependencies

Put in there any modules that can get required without our crude
source code parser being able to spot them.

=cut

our @sunken_dependencies =
    ("Catalyst::Engine::Apache", # Required by simply running under mod_perl
    );


=head2 @ignore

Put any other modules that cause false positives in there.  Consider
adding them to Build.PL instead, or rewriting your source code in a
more contrived way so that L<Module::ScanDeps> won't spot them
anymore.

=cut

our @ignore = ("IO",  # False positive by Module::ScanDeps
              );

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

We load the C<Build> script so as to be able to enumerate the
dependencies and call I<<find_pm_files()> and I<<find_test_files()>>
on it.

=cut

my $buildcode = read_file("Build");
die "Cannot read Build: $!" if ! defined $buildcode;
$buildcode =~ s|\$build->dispatch|\$build|g;
our $build = eval <<"STUFF"; die $@ if $@;
no warnings "redefine";
local *Module::Build::Base::up_to_date = sub {1}; # Shuts warning
$buildcode
STUFF
ok($build->isa("Module::Build"));

=pod

The run-time dependencies are examined in the C<blib> directory, as
the Build script will often muck around with .pm files e.g. to remove
the test suites.

=cut

my @blib_files; find({no_chdir => 1, wanted => sub {
  return unless m|\.pm$|; # Also takes care of /.svn/ files
  push @blib_files, $_;
}}, "blib") if (-d "blib");

compare_dependencies_ok(list_deps(@blib_files),
                        [keys %{$build->requires}],
                        "runtime dependencies");

=pod

On the other hand, we look for test dependencies everywhere, including
in the footer of .pm files after the __END__ block (see details in
inc/My/Tests/Below.pm)

=cut

compare_dependencies_ok(list_deps(@blib_files,
                                  keys %{$build->find_pm_files},

                                  "Build.PL"),
                        [ keys(%{$build->requires}),
                          keys(%{$build->build_requires}) ],

=head2 file2mod($filename)

Turns $filename into a module name (e.g. C<Foo/Bar.pm> becomes
C<Foo::Bar>) and returns it.

=cut

sub file2mod {
    local $_ = shift;
    s|/|::|g; s|\.pm$||;

=head2 list_deps(@files)

List dependencies found in @files, and returns them as a reference to
a hash whose keys are module names and values are references to lists
of hashes of the form

    {
      line => $line,
      file => $file,
    }

pointing at the precise location in the source code where the
dependency was found.  Only dependencies against a real C<.pm> file
are accounted for (not C<.so>, not C<.bs>); also,
L</@maintainer_dependencies> are not listed if found in
C<t/maintainer>.

=cut

=head2 skip_pod($filename, $fd, $pm)

=head2 skip_here_document($filename, $fd, $line)

Both functions advance $fd, an instance of L<IO::Handle>, to skip past
non-Perl source code constructs, and return true if they indeed did
skip something (or throw an exception if they tried and failed).  $pm
is a token returned by L<Module::ScanDeps/scan_line>; $line is a line
of the Perl source file. $filename is only used to construct the text
of error messages.

=head2 scan_line_some_more($line, $filename, $fd)

Works like L<Module::ScanDeps/scan_line>, and works around the
limitations thereof by detecting more forms of dependencies.  $fd is
available in case the code wants to slurp more lines in order to get
hold of a complete Perl statement.  $filename is only used to generate
error messages.

therefore should not be counted as a dependency.

As the name implies.  For each key in $gothashref which is not in
$expectedlistref, shows the file name(s) and line number(s) of the
chunk(s) that caused the dependency to be added.  Conversely, for each
entry in $expectedlistref which is not a key in $gothashref, warns
about a spurious dependency in Build.PL.
